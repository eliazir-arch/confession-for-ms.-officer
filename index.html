    <p>
      I hope you donâ€™t mind me saying this, but I really admire you.  
      Even though weâ€™ve only known each other for a short time,  
      youâ€™ve already managed to leave such a big impression on me.  
      Every time youâ€™re around, I canâ€™t help but feel butterflies â€”  
      and honestly, itâ€™s a feeling I never expected to happen so soon.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I donâ€™t expect you to feel the same way,  
      I just wanted to let you know whatâ€™s been in my heart.  
      Sometimes, admiration is better expressed than kept in silence,  
      and this little page is my way of being brave enough to say it.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I even found myself spending time just to know your name,  
      and somehow that small effort already makes me happy.  
      You inspire me without even trying,  
      and for that, Iâ€™m really thankful.  
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what, Iâ€™ll always be glad I met you.  
      That alone already feels like a blessing.  
    </p>
